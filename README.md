Distributed Generation System
This project aims to simulate a power plant along with a distributed generator unit. The figure below shows a diagram of a steam turbine system employed in a power plant. Notice that the steam turbine is connected to a synchronous generator through a gear box. Such a generator is connected to an industry represented here as an RL load (100 KW â€“ power factor equal to 1). Since this power system produces pollution while generates electricity, a distributed generation system with wind turbines and photovoltaic panels are installed at the load side to reduce the gas emission from the power plant. For simplification purposes, such a distributed generation is represented by a battery connected to a controlled voltage source and a low-pass filter. 
 
Specify the converter employed in the distributed generation unit able to generate half of the load power. Simulate the system constituted by the synchronous generator (assume a constant torque furnished by the gear box), load and distributed generation (battery, dc-ac converter, and low-pass-filter). The voltage generated by the distributed generator must be in phase with the voltage at the output of the synchronous generator as well as must have the same amplitude of v_as, v_bs and v_cs before connecting it in parallel.
